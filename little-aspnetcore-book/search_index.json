pequeño libro de ASP.NET Core\nPor Nate Barbettini\nCopyright © 2018.

Eres libre de compartir, copiar y redistribuir este libro en cualquier formato o mezclarlo y transformarlo para cualquier propósito (incluso comercialmente). Debes de dar el crédito apropiado y proveer la liga a la licencia.\nVisita https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es para obtener más información.\nIntroducción\n¡Gracias por elegir El pequeño libro de ASP.NET Core! Escribí este corto libro para ayudar a los desarrolladores y personas interesadas en aprender programación web a aprender acerca de ASP.NET Core 2.0, un marco de trabajo para desarrollar aplicaciones web y APIs.\nEl pequeño libro de ASP.NET Core está estructurado como un tutorial. Construirás una aplicación de principio a fin y con ello aprenderás:\n\nLos fundamentos del patrón MVC (Modelo-Vista-Controlador)\nCómo funciona el código del lado del cliente (HTML, CSS y Javascript) junto con el código del lado del servidor.\nQué es la inyección de dependencias y porque es tan útil\nCómo leer y escribir datos a una base de datos\nCómo agregar inicio de sesión, registro y seguridad\nCómo desplegar la aplicación en la web\n\nNo te preocupes, para iniciar no necesitas conocer nada sobre ASP.NET Core (o algo de lo anterior).\nAntes de empezar\nEl código de la versión final de la aplicación que construirás está disponible en Github:\nhttps://www.github.com/nbarbettini/little-aspnetcore-todo\nSiéntete libre de descargarlo si quieres ver el producto final, o compararlo mientras escribes tú propio código.\nEl libro mismo es actualizado frecuentemente con corrección de errores y adición de nuevo contenido. Si estas leyendo un archivo PDF, libro electrónico o versión impresa verifica el sitio web oficial (littleasp.net/book) para ver si hay disponible una versión actualizada. La última página del libro contiene información sobre la versión y el registro de cambios.\nLeyendo en tu propio lenguaje\nGracias a algunos fantásticos contribuidores multilingües. El pequeño libro de ASP.NET Core ha sido traducido a otros lenguajes:\n\nASP.NET Core El Kitabı(Turco)\n\n简明 ASP.NET Core 手册(Chino)\n\n\n¿A quién está dirigido este libro?\nSi eres nuevo en la programación, esté libro te introducirá los patrones y conceptos utilizados para desarrollar aplicaciones web modernas. Aprenderás como construir una aplicación web (y cómo se ensamblan todas las piezas) ¡construyendo algo desde el inicio! A pesar de que este pequeño libro no es capaz de cubrir absolutamente todo lo que necesitas conocer acerca de la programación te dará un punto de inicio de tal forma que puedas aprender tópicos más avanzados.\nSi ya haz programado en un lenguaje de lado del servidor como Node, Python, Ruby, Go o Java encontrarás muchas ideas familiares como MVC, plantillas vistas e inyección de dependencias. El código estará en C#, pero no lucirá tan diferente de lo que ya conoces. Si eres un desarollador ASP.NET MVC, ¡te sentirás como en casa! ASP.NET Core añade algunas nuevas herramientas y reutiliza (y simplifica) las cosas que ya conoces. Apuntaré sobre algunas diferencias a continuación.\nNo importa tú experiencia previa con la programación web, este libro te enseñará todo lo necesario para crear una aplicación web ASP.NET Core simple y útil. Aprenderás como desarrollar las funcionalidades usando el código del lado del servidor y del cliente. Cómo interactuar con una base de datos y cómo desplegar la aplicación en un servidor real.\n¿Qué es ASP.NET Core?\nASP.NET Core es un marco de trabajo web creado por Microsoft para desarrollar aplicaciones web, APis y microservicios. Usa patrones comunes como MVC (Modelo-Vista-Controlador), inyección de dependencias y una canalización de solicitudes formada por middleware. Es open source bajo la licencia Apache 2.0, lo que significa que está disponible de forma gratuita y la comunidad es animada para contribuir con corrección de errores y adición nuevas características.\nASP.NET Core se ejecuta sobre el entorno de ejecución .NET de Microsoft, similar a la Máquina Virtual de Java (JVM) o el intérprete de Ruby. Puedes escribir aplicaciones ASP.NET Core en un número de lenguajes (C#, Visual Basic y F#). C# es la elección más popular, y es lo que usaremos en este libro. Puedes desarrollar y ejecutar aplicaciones ASP.NET Core en Windows, Mac y Linux.\n¿Porqué necesitamos otro marco de trabajo para el desarollo web?\nAl día de hoy, existen gran cantidad de marcos de trabajo web para elegir : Node/Express, Spring, Ruby on Rails, Django,Laravel y muchos más. ¿Cuáles son las ventajas que ASP.NET Core tiene?\n\nRapidez. ASP.NET Core es rápido. Debido a que el código .NET es compilado, este se ejecuta mucho más rápido que el código de lenguajes interpretados como Javascript o Ruby. ASP.NET Core también esta optimizada para multihilos y tareas asíncronas. Es común ver una mejora en la rapidez de 5-10x sobre el código escrito en Node.js.\n\nEcosistema. ASP.NET Core puede ser nuevo, pero .NET ha estado alrededor por un largo tiempo. Hay miles de paquetes disponibles en Nuget (el administrador de paquetes para .NET; Similar a npm, Ruby gems o Maven). Actualmente hay paquetes disponibles para deserializar JSON, conectores de base de datos, generadores de PDF o casi cualquier otra cosa que se te ocurra.\n\nSeguridad. El equipo de Microsoft se toman muy enserio la seguridad y ASP.NET Core fue creado para ser seguro desde sus fundamentos.

También tienes el beneficio de tipado estático con el compilador .NET, el cuál es como tener un linter muy paranoico encendido todo el tiempo. Algunas veces esto hace más difícil hacer cosas no intencionado una variable o pedazos de datos.\n\n\n.NET Core y Estandar .NET\nA lo largo de este libro, Estarás aprendiendo acerca de ASP.NET Core (el marco de trabajo web). Ocasionalmente mencionare el entorno de ejecución .NET, la librería de soporte que ejecuta el código .NET. Si esto actualmente suena como Griego para ti, ¡solo pasa al siguiente capítulo!.\nEs posible que también hayas escuchado acerca del .NET Core y Estándar .NET. Estas son términos que se confunden así aquí esta una simple explicación:\nEstándar .NET es una interfaz independiente de plataformas que define las características y APIs. Es importante recalcar que el estándar .NET no representa ninguna código o funcionalidad, solo refleja cuántas APIs están disponibles (o que tan amplia es la superficie de la API). Por ejemplo, el estándar .NET 2.0 tiene más APIs disponibles que el estándar .NET 1.5, el cuál tiene más APIs que el estándar .NET.\n.NET Core es el motor de tiempo de ejecución de .NET que puede ser instalado en Windows, Mac o Linux. Este implementa las APIs definidas en el estándar .NET con el código especifico para cada sistema operativo. Esto es lo que instalas en tu propia máquina para programar y ejecutar aplicaciones ASP.NET Core.\nY solo como una buena medida, .NET Framework es una implementación diferente del estándar .NET que es específica para Windows. Este era el único entorno de ejecución .NET hasta que .NET Core llego y proporciono .NET para Mac y Linux. ASP.NET Core puede correr sobre el .NET Framework solo Windows, pero no tratare sobre esto demasiado.\nSi estas confundido con todos estos nombres, ¡no te preocupes! Estaremos escribiendo algo de código real muy pronto.\nNota para los desarrolladores de ASP.NET 4\nSi no has utilizado las versiones previas de ASP.NET, puedes pasar directo al siguiente capítulo.\nASP.NET Core es una re-escritura completa desde los fundamentos de ASP.NET con el objetivo de modernizar el marco de trabajo y finalmente desacoplarlo de System.Web, ISS y Windows. Si recuerdas todo las cosas sobre OWIN/Kataba de ASP.NET 4, estas casi la mitad ahí: el proyecto Katana se convirtió en ASP.NET 5 el cual finalmente fue renombrado como ASP.NET Core.\nDebido al legado de Katana, la clase Startup es el frente y centro, y no hay más Application_Start o Global.asax. La canalización entera esta manejada por middleware, y no hay una separación entre MVC y Web API: los controladores pueden simplemente retornar vistas, códigos de estado o datos. La inyección de dependencias viene integrada, así que no tienes que instalar y configurar un contenedor como StructureMap o Ninject si no deseas hacerlo. Y el marco de trabajo .NET ha sido optimizado para la velocidad y eficiencia del motor de tiempo de ejecución.\nBien, es suficiente de introducción. ¡Profundicemos en ASP.NET Core\n"},"chapters/your-first-application/":{"url":"chapters/your-first-application/","title":"Tú primera aplicación","keywords":"","body":"Tú primera aplicación\n¿Estas listo para crear tú primera aplicación web con ASP.NET Core?

Si estas usando Visual Studio, necesitaras abrir el archivo de proyecto directamente. Visual Studio te solicitara guardar el archivo de la solución, el cuál debes guardar en el directorio raíz de la solución (la primera carpeta llamado AspNetCoreTodo). También puedes crear un proyecto ASP.NET Core directamente o en Visual Studio usando la plantillas disponibles en Archivo - Nuevo Proyecto.\n\nUna nota acerca de Git\nSi usar Git o Github para manejar el control de código fuente, ahora es buen momento para hacer un git init e iniciar el repositorio en el directorio raíz del proyecto:\ncd ..\ngit init\n\nAsegúrate que agregues un archivo .gitignore que ignora las carpeta bin y obj. La plantilla de .gitignore para Visual Studio en el repositorio de Github funciona genial.\nHay mucho más que explorar, así que profundicemos e iniciemos a desarrollar una aplicación.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/","title":"Fundamentos de MVC","keywords":"","body":"Fundamentos de MVC\nEn este capítulo, explorarás el patrón MVC en ASP.NET Core. MVC (Modelo-Vista-Controlador) es un patrón para crear aplicaciones web que es usado en casi todos los marcos de desarollo web (ejemplos populares son Ruby on Rails y Express), adicionalmente marcos de trabajo del lado de cliente con Javascript como Angular. Las aplicaciones móviles sobre iOS y Android también usan una variante de MVC.\nComo el nombre sugiere MVC tiene tres componentes: modelos, vistas y controladores. Los Controladores gestionan las solicitudes de entrada desde un cliente o un navegador web y deciden acerca de que código ejecutar. Las vistas son plantillas (usualmente HTML más un lenguaje de plantillas como Handlebars, Pug o Razor) que contienen datos añadidos a el que luego son mostrados a los usuario.Los Modelos mantienen los datos que son agregado a las vistas, o los datos que son ingresados por los usuarios.\nUn patrón común para el código MVC es:\n\nEl controlador recibe una petición y busca alguna información en una base de datos.\nEl controlador crea un modelo con la información y la adjunta a la vista.\nLa vista es generada y mostrada en el navegador del usuario.\nEl usuario presiona un botón o envía un formulario, lo que enviá una nueva solicitud al controlador y el ciclo se repite.\n\nSi has trabajado con MVC en otros lenguajes, te sentirás como en casa en ASP.NET Core MVC. Si eres nuevo en MVC, este capítulo te enseñara lo básico y te ayudará a iniciar.\nLo que vas a programar\nEl ejercicio de \"Hola Mundo\" de MVC es construir una aplicación de lista de tareas. Es un proyecto genial ya que es pequeño y simple en alcance, pero trata cada una de las partes de MVC y cubre muchos conceptos que usaras en un aplicación más grande.\nEn este libro, desarrollaras una aplicación de gestión de tareas pendientes que dejara al usuario agregar elementos a su lista de tareas y una vez que la tarea se ha completado. Más específicamente estarás creando:\n\nUna aplicación web de servidor (a veces llamada Back-End) usando a ASP.NET Core, C# y el patrón MVC.\nUna base de datos para almacenar la lista de tareas del usuario usando el motor de base de datos SQLite y un sistema llamado Entity Framework Core.\nLas páginas web y la interfaz con la que el usuario interacturá vía el navegador. Usando HTML, CSS y Javascript (llamado el FrontEnd).\nUn formulario de inicio de sesión y verificación de seguridad así cada usuario mantendrá su lista de tareas privada.\n¿Suena bien? ¡Vamos a construirla! si no haz creado una aplicación nueva en ASP.NET Core proyecto usando dotnet new mvc, sigue los pasos en el capítulo anterior, debes ser capaz de construir y ejecutar el proyecto y ver la pantalla de bienvenida,\n\n\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/create-controller.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/create-controller.html","title":"Crear un controlador","keywords":"","body":"Crear un controlador\nActualmente ya hay algunos controladores en la carpeta Controllers, incluyendo HomeController que generá la pantalla de bienvenida por defautl cuando visitas http://localhost:5000. Puedes ignorar estos controladores por ahora.\nCrea un nuevo controlador para la funcionalidad de la lista de tareas y agrega el siguiente código:\nControllers/TodoController.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Controllers\n{\n    public class TodoController : Controller\n    {\n        // Las acciones van aquí\n    }\n}\n\nLas rutas que son manejadas por el controlador son llamadas acciones, y son representadas por métodos en la clase controlador. Por ejemplo, el HomeController incluye tres métodos de acción (Index, About, y Contact) las cuales son mapeadas por ASP.NET Core a estas rutas URLs:\nlocalhost:5000/Home         -> Index()\nlocalhost:5000/Home/About   -> About()\nlocalhost:5000/Home/Contact -> Contact()\nHay un gran número de convenciones (patrones comunes) usados por ASP.NET Core, tales como patrón que FooController se convierte en /Foo, y la acción Index puede ser omitida de la URL. Puedes personalizar este comportamiento si así lo deseas, pero por ahora, usaremos las convenciones predefinidas.\nAgrega un nueva acción llamada Index al TodoController, remplazando el comentario // Las acciones van aquí;\npublic class TodoController : Controller\n{\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        // Obtener las tareas desde la base de datos\n\n        // Colocar los tareas en un modelo\n\n        // Genera la vista usando el modelo\n    }\n}\n\nLos métodos de acción pueden regresar vistas, datos JSON, o códigos de estatus HTTP como 200 OK y 404 Not Found.\nEl tipo de retorno IActionResult te da la flexibilidad de regresar cualquiera de estos desde una acción. Es una buena práctica mantener los controladores tan ligeros como sea posible. En este caso, el controlador será responsable de obtener la lista de tareas desde la base de datos, poniendo estas tareas en un modelo que la vista pueda entender, y enviara la vista de regreso al navegador del usuario.\nAntes de que puedas escribir el resto del código del controlador, necesitas crear un modelo y una vista.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/create-models.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/create-models.html","title":"Crear modelos","keywords":"","body":"Crear modelos\nHay dos clases modelo diferentes que necesitan ser creadas: un modelo que representa las tareas almacenadas en la base de datos (a veces llamadas entidades) y el modelo que será combinado con la vista (MV en MVC) y sera enviado al navegador del usuario. Debido a que ambos son referidos como modelos, prefiero referirme al último como View Model.\nPrimero, crea un clase llamada TodoItem en la carpeta Models:\nModels/TodoItem.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Models\n{\n    public class TodoItem\n    {\n        public Guid Id { get; set; }\n\n        public bool IsDone { get; set; }\n\n        [Required]\n        public string Title { get; set; }\n\n        public DateTimeOffset? DueAt { get; set; }\n    }\n}\n\nEsta clase define lo que base de datos necesitara para almacenar cada tarea :Un ID, un titulo o nombre, si la tarea esta completada y la fecha de termino. Cada linea define una propiedad de la clase:\n\nLa propiedad Id es un GUID o un Identificador Global Único. Los Guid son cadenas largas de letras y números como por ejemplo, 43ec09f2-7f70-4f4b-9559-65011d5781bb. Debido a que los GUIDs son aleatorios y extremadamente improbables que sean repitan, son utilizados frecuentemente con identificadores únicos. También puede usar un número (entero) como un identificador pero tienes que configurar tú base de datos para que siempre incremente el número cuando un nuevas filas son añadidas a la base de datos. Los Id son generados de forma aleatoria, así que no tienes que preocuparte de generarlos.\n\nLa propiedad IsDone es un booleano ( valores true/false ), De forma predeterminada, sera falso para todos los nuevos elementos. Después escribirás código para cambiar esta propiedad a true cuando el usuario presiona una casilla de verificación en la vista.\n\nLa propiedad Title es una cadena (valor texto). Esta mantendrá el nombre o descripción de la tarea pendiente. El atributo [Required] le dice ASP.NET Core que esta cadena no puede ser nula o vaciá.\n\nLa propiedad DueAt es un DateTimeOffset, el cual es un tipo de C# que almacena un fecha/hora con la diferencia de horario con el UTC. Guardar la fecha, la hora y la zona horaria juntas hace fácil visualizar las fechas precisamente en sistemas en diferentes zonas horarios.\n\n\nNota que el símbolo de interrogación ? después del tipo DateTimeOffset? este marca que la propiedad DueAt es nullable u opcional. Si el ? no se incluye, todos los las tareas pendientes necesitarían una fecha de entrega. Las propiedad ID y IsDone no son marcadas como nullables, asi que ellas son requeridas y siempre tendrá un valor (o valor por omisión).\n\nLa cadenas en C# son siempre nullables, así que no es necesario marcar el titulo como nullable: Las cadenas de C# pueden ser nulas, vacíos o contener texto.\n\nCada propiedad es seguida por get; set;, las cuales es una forma corta de decir que la propiedad es de lectura/escritura (más técnicamente que tiene métodos modificadores.)\nEn este punto, no importa a cual es la base de datos utilizada. Podría ser SQL Server, MySQL, Mongo Db, Redis o algo más exótico. Este modelo define como lucirá en C# una fila o entrada en la base de datos así no tienes que preocuparte acerca de los detalles sobre la base de datos en el código de tú aplicación. Este simple estilo de modelo es algunas veces llamado a POCO (Plain Old C# Object por sus siglas en ingles).\nLa vista modelo\nFrecuentemente, el modelo que almacenas en la base de datos es similar pero no exactamente el mismo que deseas usar en la MVC (la vista modelo). En este caso, el modelo TodoItem representa a un único elemento de la base de datos. Pero la vista puede necesitar mostrar dos o cientos tareas pendientes (dependiendo que tal malamente el usuario esta procrastinando).\nDebido a esto, la vista modelo puede ser una clase separada que mantienen un arreglo de TodoItem\nModels/TodoViewModel.cs\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Models\n{\n    public class TodoViewModel\n    {\n        public TodoItem[] Items { get; set; }\n    }\n}\n\nAhora que tienes algunos modelos, es tiempo de crear una vista que usa un TodoViewModel y generará el HTML correcto para mostrar al usuario su lista de tareas pendientes.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/create-view.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/create-view.html","title":"Crear una vista","keywords":"","body":"Crear una vista\nLas vistas en ASP.NET Core se construyen usando el lenguaje de plantillas Razor, el cual combina HTML y código C#. Si haz escrito páginas usan Handlebar mustaches, ERM en Ruby On Rail or Thumeleaf en Java, ya tienes la idea básica)\nLa mayoría del código de las vistas es solo HTML, con ocasionales enunciados de C# necesarios para extraer datos del modelo de la vista y convertirlos a texto o a HTML. Los enunciados C# tienen como prefijo el símbolo @\nLa vista generada por la acción Index del controlador TodoController necesita obtener los datos de la vista modelo, (una colección de tareas pendientes) y mostrarlas en un tabla atractiva para el usuario. Por convención, las vistas van colocadas en la carpeta Views en una subcarpeta correspondiente al nombre del controlador. El nombre del archivo es el nombre de la acción con un una extensión .cshtml.\nCrea una carpeta llamada Todo dentro la carpeta Views, y agrega este archivo:\nViews/Todo/Index.cshtml\n@model TodoViewModel\n\n@{\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Manage your todo list\";\n}\n\n\n  @ViewData[\"Title\"]\n\n  \n      \n          \n              &#x2714;\n              Item\n              Due\n          \n      \n\n      @foreach (var item in Model.Items)\n      {\n          \n              \n                \n              \n              @item.Title\n              @item.DueAt\n          \n      }\n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nEn la parte superior del archivo, la directiva @ model le dice a Razor a qué modelo espera que se vincule esta vista. Se accede al modelo a través de la propiedad Model.\nSuponiendo que hay elementos de tareas pendientes en Model.Items, la instrucciónforeach se desplazará sobre cada tarea pendiente y mostrará una fila de la tabla (elemento  ) que contiene el nombre y la fecha de vencimiento de la tarea . También se representa una casilla de verificación que permitirá al usuario marcar la tarea como completa.\nEl archivo de diseño\nQuizás se pregunte dónde está el resto del HTML: ¿qué pasa con la etiqueta  o el encabezado y pie de página de la página? ASP.NET Core utiliza una vista de diseño que define la estructura base en la que se procesan todas las demás vistas. Esta almacenado en Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml.\nLa plantilla predeterminada de ASP.NET Core incluye Bootstarp y JQuery en su archivo de Layout. Puedes crear rápidamente una aplicación web, Por supuesto que puedes usar tus propias librerías CSS y Javascript si asi lo deseas.\nPersonalizando la hoja de estilos\nLa plantilla predefinida también incluye un hoja de estilos con algunas reglas CSS básicas. La hoja de estilos es almacenada en el directorio wwwroot/css,Agrega unas cuantas nuevas reglas CSS al final del, archivo site.css:\nwwwroot/css/site.css\ndiv.todo-panel {\n  margin-top: 15px;\n}\n\ntable tr.done {\n  text-decoration: line-through;\n  color: #888;\n}\n\nPuedes usar reglas CSS como estas para personalizar como se visualizan y lucen tus páginas.\nASP.NET Core y Razor pueden hacer mucho más, como vistas parciales y vistas generadas en el servidor componentes, pero un simple Layout y una vista es todo lo que necesitaras por ahora. La documentación oficial(en https://docs.asp.net de ASP.NET Core contiene muchos ejemplos si deseas aprender más.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/add-service-class.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/add-service-class.html","title":"Agregar una clase de servicio","keywords":"","body":"Agregar una clase de servicio\nHaz creado un modelo, una vista y un controlador. Antes de usar el modelo y la vista en el controlador, también necesitas escribir código que obtendrá la lista de tareas de los usuarios desde la base de datos.\nPuedes escribir este código directamente en el controlador, pero es una mejor práctica mantener tu código separado. ¿Por qué? en una aplicación real grande, tendrás que hacer malabares con muchos asuntos:\n\nGenerar la Vista y manipular datos de entrada: esto actualmente es realzado por el controlador.\nEjecutar las reglas de negocio, o código que esta relacionado con el propósito y negocio de tu aplicación, en una aplicación de lista de tareas, reglas de negocio significa decisiones como configurar la fecha por omisión para la entrega o solo mostrar tareas que están incompletas. Otros ejemplo de lógica de negocio incluyen calcular el costo total con base en el precio, de los productos, razón de impuesto o verificar si algún jugador tiene puntos suficiente para subir de nivel en un juego.\nObtener y guardar tareas desde la base de datos.\n\nUna vez más es posible hacer todas estas cosas en un solo y enorme controlador, que rápidamente se convertiría en difícil de manejar y probar. En lugar es común ver aplicaciones dividen en dos o tres o más capas y tiers de tal forma que cada una maneja uno (y solo una) aspecto de la aplicación. Esto ayuda a mantener el controlador tan simple como sea posible, y hace más fácil probar y cambiar la lógica de negocio y el código de acceso a base de datos después.\nSeparado tu aplicación en esta forma es a veces llamada mult-tier o n-tier arquitectura. En algunos casos los tiers o capas son proyectos completamente separados. Pero otras veces i solo se referencia a como las clases son organizadas y utilizadas. Lo más importante es pensar a cerca de como dividir tu aplicación en piezas manejables y evitar tener controladores o clases enormes que intentan hacer todo.\nPara este proyecto, usaras dos capa de aplicación: una capa de presentación compuesta de controladores y vistas que interactúan con el usuario, y una capa de servicio que combina las reglas del negocio con el código de accesos a base de datos. La capa de presentación ya existe asi que el siguiente paso es crear un servicio que maneja las reglas de negocio para las tareas y las guarda en una base da datos.\n\nLa mayoría de los proyectos grandes usan una arquitectura 3-tier: una capa de presentación, una capa lógica de servicios y una capa de repositorio de datos. Un repositorio es una clase que que solo esta enfocada en código de acceso a base de datos (no lógica de negocios). En esta aplicación, por simplicidad, código combinaras estas en un sola capa de servicio pero siéntete libre de experimentar con diferentes formas de estructurar el código.\n\nCrear una interfaz\nEl lenguaje de programación C# incluye el concepto de interfaces, donde la definición de los métodos y propiedades de un objeto es separada de la clase que actualmente contiene el código de aquellos métodos y propiedades. Las interfaces hace fácil mantener tus clases desacopladas y fáciles de probar, como veras aquí (y después en el capítulo _Pruebas Automáticas)Usaras una interfaces para represente el servicio que puede interactuá con los elementos en la base de datos.\nPor convención, el nombre de las interfaces tiene el prefijo \"I\". Crea un nuevo archivo en el directorio Services:\nServices/ITodoItemService.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Models;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Services\n{\n    public interface ITodoItemService\n    {\n        Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync();\n    }\n}\n\nNota que el espacio de nombres de este archivo es AspNetCoreTodo.Services. Los espacios de nombres son una forma de organizar los archivos de código .NET. y se acostumbra nombrar el espacio de nombres siguiendo el directorio en que esta almacenado del archivo (AspNetCoreTodo.Services para archivos en el directorio  Services y asi sucesivamente).\nDebido a que este archivo (en el espacio de nombres AspNetCoreTodo.Services) hace referencia a la clase TodoItem (en el espacio de nombres AspNetCoreTodo.Models), debe incluir una declaración using en la parte superior del archivo para importar ese espacio de nombres. Sin la instrucción using, verás un error como:\nThe type or namespace name 'TodoItem' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\nDebido a que esta es una interfaces, no hay ningún código aquí, solo la definición (o la firma del método) GetIncompleteItemsAsync. Este método no requiere parámetros y regresa un objeto del tipo  Task.\n\nSi la sintaxis parece confusa, recuerda \"una Tarea(Task) que contiene un arreglo de TodoItems\"\n\nEl tipo Task es similar un futuro o promesa, y se usa aquí porque este método sera asíncrono. En otras palabras es posible que el método no pueda ser capaz de regresar la lista de tareas pendientes de forma inmediata porque necesita primero interactuar con la base de datos primero. (Más sobre esto después).\nCrear la clase de servicio\nAhora que la interfaz esta definida, estas listo para crear la clase del servicio actual. Cubriré el código de acceso a base de datos a detalle en el capítulo Usar una base de datos, así que por ahora solo usaras datos falsos y siempre regresara 2 tareas definidas de forma estática;\nServices/FakeTodoItemService.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Models;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Services\n{\n    public class FakeTodoItemService : ITodoItemService\n    {\n        public Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync()\n        {\n            var item1 = new TodoItem\n            {\n                Title = \"Learn ASP.NET Core\",\n                DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(1)\n            };\n\n            var item2 = new TodoItem\n            {\n                Title = \"Build awesome apps\",\n                DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(2)\n            };\n\n            return Task.FromResult(new[] { item1, item2 });\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nLa clase FakeTodoItemService implementa la interfaz ITodoItemService pero siempre regresa el mismo arreglo de dos TodoItem. Usaras esta para poblar el controlador y la vista y después agregaras código de bases de datos real en Usando una base de datos.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/use-dependency-injection.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/use-dependency-injection.html","title":"Usar inyección de dependencias","keywords":"","body":"Usar inyección de dependencias\nRegresa al controlador TodoController, añade algo de código para trabajar con el servicio ITodoItemService:\npublic class TodoController : Controller\n{\n    private readonly ITodoItemService _todoItemService;\n\n    public TodoController(ITodoItemService todoItemService)\n    {\n        _todoItemService = todoItemService;\n    }\n\n    public IActionResult Index()\n    {\n        // Obtener las tareas desde la base de datos\n\n        // Coloca los elemento dentro de un modelo\n\n        // Pasa la vista al model y visualiza\n    }\n}\n\nDebido a que ITodoItemService esta el el espacio de nombres \"Services\", necesitaras agregar la instrucción using al principio del archivo:\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Services;\n\nLa primera linea de la clase declara un campo privado para tener una referencia al ITodoItemService. Esta variable te deja usar el servicio desde el método de acción Index después (verás como hacerlo en un minuto).\nLa línea public TodoController(ITodoItemService todoItemService) define un constructor para la clase. El constructor es un método especial que es invocado cada que deseas crear una nueva instancia de la clase (en este caso la clase TodoController). Por haber agregado un parámetro ITodoItemService al constructor, haz declarado que para crear TodoController necesitar proveer un objeto que implementa la interfaz ITodoItemService.\n\nLas interfaces son increíbles ya que ayudan a desacoplar (separar) la lógica de tu aplicación. Debido a que el controlador depende de la interfaz ITodoItemService, y no de una clase especifica este no conoce o le importa cual clase es actualmente dada. Esto hará realmente fácil probar parte de la aplicación separadamente, Cubriré la pruebas en detalle en el capítulo Pruebas automáticas.\n\nFinalmente ahora puedes usar el ITodoItemService (a través de la variable privada que declaraste) en tu métodos de acción para obtener los elemento desde la capa de servicio:\npublic IActionResult Index()\n{\n    var items = await _todoItemService.GetIncompleteItemsAsync();\n\n    // ...\n}\n\n¿ Recuerdas que el método GetIncompleteItemsAsync regresa un Task? Regresar un Task significa que el método no necesariamente tendrá un resultado, pero puedes usar la palabra clave await para asegurarte que tu código espera hasta que el resultado esta listo antes de continuar. \nEl patrón de Task es común cuando tu código realiza peticiones a la base de datos o una API de servicio, porque no será capaz de regresar un resultado real hasta que la base de datos (o red) responda.Si haz usado promesas o callbacks en Javascript u otro lenguaje, Taskes la misma idea: la promesa que habrá un resultado - en algún tiempo futuro.\n\nSi haz tenido que tratar con el \"infierno callback\" en el código heredado de Javascript, estas de suerte.\nSi has tenido que lidiar con el \"infierno de devolución de llamada\" en un código JavaScript más antiguo, estás de suerte. Tratar con el código asíncrono en .NET es mucho más fácil gracias a la magia de la palabra clave \"esperar\". await permite que su código se detenga en una operación asíncrona, y luego retome lo que dejó cuando la base de datos subyacente o la solicitud de red finaliza. Mientras tanto, su aplicación no está bloqueada, ya que puede procesar otras solicitudes según sea necesario. Este patrón es simple pero requiere un poco de tiempo para acostumbrarse, así que no se preocupe si esto no tiene sentido de inmediato. ¡Sigue siguiéndolo!\n\nEl único problema es que necesitas actualizar la firma del método Index para devolver un Tasken lugar de IActionResult, y marcarlo como async:\nEl único no tiene que actualizar la firma del método Index para regresar a Task en place of sol un IActionResult, y marcarlo con async:\npublic async Task Index()\n{\n    var items = await _todoItemService.GetIncompleteItemsAsync();\n\n    // Coloca las tareas en un modelo\n\n    // Pasa la vista al modelo y la genera\n}\n\nYa casi terminamos. Has hecho que el TodoController dependa de la interface ITodoItemService, pero aun no le has dicho a ASP.NET Core que tu deseas el FakeTodoItemService sea el servicio actual que use debajo del capo. Parecerá obvio ahora debido a que solo existe una clase que implementa la interfaz ITodoItemService, pero después tendrás múltiples clases que implementan la misma interface, asi que ser explicito es necesario.\nDeclarando (o conectando) cual clase concreta para usar para cada interface se hace en el método ConfigureServices de la clase Startup. Ahora mismo algo como esto:\nStartup.cs\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n{\n    // (... some code)\n\n    services.AddMvc();\n}\n\nEl trabajo del método ConfigureServices es agregar cosas al contenedor de servicios, o a la colección de servicios que ASP.NET Core conocerá. La linea services.AddMvc agregue el servicio que el sistema interno de ASP.NET Core, necesita (como un experimento, intenta comentar esta línea). Cualquier otro servicio que desees usar en tu aplicación debe ser agregado al contenedor de servicios en el método ConfigureServices.\nAgrega la siguiente linea en cualquier lugar dentro del método ConfigureServices,\nservices.AddSingleton();\n\nEsta linea le especifica a ASP.NET Core que cada que se solicite ITodoItemService en un constructor deberá usar la clase FakeTodoItemService.\nAddSingleton agrega un servicio al contenedor de servicios como un singleton. Esto significa que se creará una sola instancia del FakeTodoItemService y se reutilizara dondequiera que el servicio es solicitado. Después, cuando escribas una clase de servicio diferente, una que interactuá con la base de datos usaras una aproximación diferente llamada (scoped), Te explicaré porque en el capítulo Usando una base de datos.\n!Esto es todo! Cuando una petición llega y es dirigida al TodoController, ASP.NET Core buscará en los servicios disponibles y automáticamente regresara el FakeTodoItemService cuando el controlador requiere por un ITodoItemService. Debido a que los servicios son \"inyectados\" desde el contenedor de servicios, este patrón es llamado inyección de dependencias.\n"},"chapters/mvc-basics/finish-controller.html":{"url":"chapters/mvc-basics/finish-controller.html","title":"Terminando el controlador","keywords":"","body":"Finalizando el controlador\nEl último paso es finalizar el código del controlador .

Hibernate para Java y ActiveRecord para Ruby son dos ORM bien conocidos.\nExisten varios ORM para .NET, incluido uno creado por Microsoft e incluido en ASP.NET Core de forma predeterminada: Entity Framework Core. Entity Framework Core facilita la conexión a varios tipos de bases de datos diferentes y le permite utilizar el código C# para crear consultas de base de datos que se asignan nuevamente a los modelos C# (POCO Plain Old CLR Objects).\n\n¿Recuerda cómo crear una interfaz de servicio desacopla el código del controlador de la clase de servicio real? Entity Framework Core es como una gran interfaz sobre su base de datos. Su código de C# puede permanecer independiente de la base de datos, y puede intercambiar diferentes proveedores dependiendo de la tecnología de base de datos subyacente.\n\nEntity Framework Core puede conectarse a bases de datos relacionales como SQL Server, PostgreSQL y MySQL también funciona con bases de datos NoSQL (documentos) como Mongo.

Ya que usó dotnet new y la plantilla MVC + Individual Auth para configurar su proyecto, ya los tiene:\n\nLos paquetes de Entity Framework Core. Estos se incluyen de forma predeterminada en todos los proyectos de ASP.NET Core.\n\nUna base de datos (naturalmente). El archivo app.db en el directorio raíz del proyecto es una pequeña base de datos SQLite creada para usted por dotnet new. SQLite es un motor de base de datos ligero que puede ejecutarse sin necesidad de instalar herramientas adicionales en su máquina, por lo que es fácil y rápido de usar en el desarrollo.\n\nUna clase de contexto de base de datos. El contexto de la base de datos es una clase de C# que proporciona un punto de entrada a la base de datos. Es la forma en que su código interactuará con la base de datos para leer y guardar elementos. Ya existe una clase de contexto básico en el archivo Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs.\n\n Una cadena de conexión . Ya sea que se conecte a una base de datos de archivos local (como SQLite) o una base de datos alojada en otro lugar, definirá una cadena que contenga el nombre o la dirección de la base de datos a la que se conectará. Esto ya está configurado para usted en el archivo appsettings.json: la cadena de conexión para la base de datos SQLite es DataSource = app.db.\n\n\nEntity Framework Core usa el contexto de la base de datos, junto con la cadena de conexión, para establecer una conexión con la base de datos. Debe indicar a Entity Framework Core qué contexto, cadena de conexión y proveedor de base de datos deben utilizar en el método ConfigureServices de la clase Startup. Esto es lo que está definido para ti, gracias a la plantilla:\nservices.AddDbContext(options =>\n    options.UseSqlite(\n        Configuration.GetConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\")));\n\nEste código agrega el ApplicationDbContext al contenedor de servicio, y le dice a Entity Framework Core que use el proveedor de base de datos SQLite, con la cadena de conexión de la configuración (appsettings.json).\nComo puedes ver, dotnet new ¡crea muchas cosas por ti!

Hasta que se solucione este problema, use esta solución:\n\nComente o elimine las líneas migrationBuilder.AddForeignKey en el método Up.\nComente o elimine cualquier línea migrationBuilder.DropForeignKey en el método Down.\n\nSi usa una base de datos SQL completa, como SQL Server o MySQL, esto no será un problema y no tendrá que hacer esta solución (la cual es ciertamente hacker).\nAplicar la migración\nEl último paso después de crear una (o más) migraciones es aplicarlas realmente a la base de datos:\ndotnet ef database update\nEste comando hará que Entity Framework Core cree la tabla Items en la base de datos.\n\nSi desea revertir la base de datos, puede proporcionar el nombre de la migración anterior:\ndotnet ef database update CreateIdentitySchema\nEsto ejecutará los métodos Down de cualquier migración más reciente que la migración que especifique.\nSi necesita borrar por completo la base de datos y comenzar de nuevo, ejecute dotnet ef database database seguido de dotnet ef database update para volver a armar la base de datos y llevarla a la migración actual.\n\n¡Eso es!

El ApplicationDbContext ya se está agregando al contenedor de servicios en el método ConfigureServices, por lo que está disponible para inyección aquí.\nEchemos un vistazo más de cerca al código del método GetIncompleteItemsAsync. Primero, usa la propiedad Items del contexto para acceder a todos los elementos de la tarea en el DbSet:\nvar items = await _context.Items\n\nLuego, el método Where se usa para filtrar solo las tareas que no están completas:\n.Where(x => x.IsDone == false)\n\nEl método Where es una característica de C # llamada LINQ (Lenguaje INtegrated Query), que se inspira en la programación funcional y facilita la expresión de consultas de base de datos en código. Bajo el capó, Entity Framework Core traduce el método Where en una declaración como SELECT * FROM Items WHERE IsDone = 0, o un documento de consulta equivalente en una base de datos NoSQL.\nFinalmente, el método ToArrayAsync le dice a Entity Framework Core que obtenga todas las entidades que coincidan con el filtro y las devuelva como una matriz. El método ToArrayAsync es asíncrono (devuelve un Task), por lo que debe estar esperando await para obtener su valor.\nPara que el método sea un poco más corto, puedes eliminar la variable intermedia items y simplemente devolver el resultado de la consulta directamente (que hace lo mismo):\npublic async Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync()\n{\n    return await _context.Items\n        .Where(x => x.IsDone == false)\n        .ToArrayAsync();\n}\n\nActualizar el contenedor de servicios\nDebido a que eliminó la clase FakeTodoItemService, deberá actualizar la línea en ConfigureServices que está cableando la interfaz ITodoItemService:\nservices.AddScoped();\n\nAddScoped agrega su servicio al contenedor de servicio utilizando el ciclo de vida de ámbito. Esto significa que se creará una nueva instancia de la clase TodoItemService durante cada solicitud web. Esto es necesario para las clases de servicio que interactúan con una base de datos.\n\nAgregar una clase de servicio que interactúa con Entity Framework Core (y su base de datos) con el ciclo de vida de singleton (u otros ciclos de vida) puede causar problemas, debido a cómo Entity Framework Core administra las conexiones de base de datos por solicitud bajo el capó. Para evitarlo, utilice siempre el ciclo de vida con ámbito para los servicios que interactúan con Entity Framework Core.\n\n¡El TodoController que depende de un ITodoItemService inyectado será maravillosamente inconsciente del cambio en las clases de servicios, pero bajo el capó estará usando Entity Framework Core y¡hablando con una base de datos real!\nPruébalo\nInicie la aplicación y navegue a http://localhost:5000/todo.

Es es el mismo modelo TodoItem que creaste en el capítulo Fundamentos de MVC para guardar la información acerca de la tarea. Cuando es usado aque como un parámetro de acción, ASP.NET Core automáticamente ejecuta un proceso llamado model binding.\nModel binding busca en los datos de la solicitud e intente inteligentemente coincidir los datos con las propiedad del modelo. En otras palabras, cuando el usuario envía el formulario y su navegador POST hacia esta acción, ASP.NET Core obtendrá esta información desde el formulario y la colocara en la variable newItem.\nEl atributo [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] antes de la acción le dice a ASP.NET Core que est debe buscar (y verificar) el código oculto de verificación qu fue agregado al formulario por el tag helper asp-action. Este es una importante medida de seguridad para prevenir falsificación de petición en sitios cruzados. donde tus usuario no puedes ser engañados enviando los datos del formulario a sitios maliciosos. El código de verificación se asegura que la aplicación es actualmente la única que muestra el formulario y recibe los datos del formulario.\nEcha un vistazo AddItemPartial.cshtml a la vista una vez más. La linea @model TodoItem al principio del archivo le dice a ASP.NET Core que la vista debe esperar ser pareada con el modelo TodoItem. Esto hace posible usar asp-for=\"Title\" en la etiqueta  para dejar ASP.NET Core conozca que esta elemento input es para la propiedad Title.\nPorque la línea @model, la vista parcial espeta recibir un objecto TodoItem cuando es generada. Pasando a esta un new TodoItem a través Html.PartialAsync inicializa el formulario con una tarea en blanco.(Intenta añadir { Title = \"hello\" } y ve que pasa!)\nDurante el model binding, cualquier propiedad del model que no pueden se coincidente con los campos en la solicitud. Desde que el formulario solo incluye un elemento input Title, puede espera que las otras propiedades en TodoItem (la bandera IsDone, la fecha de DueAt) serán vacías o contienes valores predefinidos.\n\nEn lugar de reutilizar el modelo TodoItem, otra aproximación seria crear un modelo separado (como NewTodoItem ) que solo es usado para esta acción y solo tiene las propiedades específicas (Titulo) que necesitas para agregar una nueva tarea. Enlazamiento de modelo es aun usar, pero de esta forma haz separado el modelo que es usado para guardar una tarea en la base de datos desde el modelo que es usado para enlazar la solicitud de entrada. Es a veces llamado un binding model or a data transfer object\n\nDespués de enlazar los dato de la solicitud al modelo, ASP.NET Core también ejecuta validación del modelo. La validación verifica si los datos en el modelo desde la solicitud de entrada hacen sentidos o es validad. Tu puedes agregar atributos a el modelo para decirle ASP.NET Core como debe ser validado.\nEl atributo [Required] en el titulo le dice al validador del modelo de ASP.NET Core considera el titulo invalido si no esta o esta en blanco. Dale un vistazo al código de la acción AddItem: el primer bloque checa si el ModelStatees valido.(el resultado de la validación del modelo). Es opcional hacer esta verificación de validación justo en el principio de la acción:\nif (!ModelState.IsValid)\n{\n    return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n}\n\nSi el ModelState es invalido por cualquier razón, el navegador será redireccionado a la ruta /Todo/Index, la cual refresca la página.\nDespués, el controlador llama a la capa de servicio para realizar la operación de base de datos actual de guardar la nueva tarea:\nvar successful = await _todoItemService.AddItemAsync(newItem);\nif (!successful)\n{\n    return BadRequest(new { error = \"Could not add item.\" });\n}\n\nEl método AddItemAsync regresa true or false dependiendo el clic, a es item fue agregado satisfactoriamente a la base. Si este falla por alguna razón, la acción regresará un error HTTP 400 Bad Request junto con el objeto que contiene un mensaje de error.\nFinalmente, si todo es completado sin errores, la acción redirige el navegador a la ruta /Todo/Index, la cual refresca la página y muestra la nueva, actualizar la listas de tareas de cada usuario.\nAgregar un método de servicio\nSi estas usando un editor de código que entiende C#, veras unas líneas en rojas bajo AddItemAsync debido a que el método no existe aun.\nComo ultimo paso, necesitas agregar un método a la capa de servicio. Primero agregalo a la definición de la interfaz en ITodoItemService:\npublic interface ITodoItemService\n{\n    Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync();\n\n    Task AddItemAsync(TodoItem newItem);\n}\n\nDespues, la implementación actual en TodoItemService:\npublic async Task AddItemAsync(TodoItem newItem)\n{\n    newItem.Id = Guid.NewGuid();\n    newItem.IsDone = false;\n    newItem.DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(3);\n\n    _context.Items.Add(newItem);\n\n    var saveResult = await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n    return saveResult == 1;\n}\n\nLa propiedad newItem.Title ya ha sido configurada por el enlazador de modelos de ASP.NET Core, asi este método solo necesita asignar un Id y confiar el valor por omisión para las otras propiedades. Entonces, la nueva tarea es agregadas al contacto de base de datos. Esta no se guarda hasta que llamas al método SaveChangesAsync(). Si el operación de guardar fue satisfactorio SaveChangesAsync() regresará 1.\nPruebaló\nEjecuta la aplicación y agrega algunas tareas a tu lista mediante el formulario. Debido a que las tareas son almacenadas en la base de datos, estas estarán ahí incluso después de detener e iniciar la aplicación otra vez.\n\nComo un reto extra, intenta agregar un date picker usando HTML y Javascript y deja que el usuario elija una fecha (opcional) para la propiedad DueAt. Entonces usa, esa fecha en lugar de siempre hacer que una nueva tarea tenga fecha de entrega en 3 días.\n\n"},"chapters/add-more-features/complete-with-checkbox.html":{"url":"chapters/add-more-features/complete-with-checkbox.html","title":"Completar las tareas con una casilla de verificación","keywords":"","body":"Completa los elementos con una casilla de verificación\nAgregar tareas a tú lista de tareas es genial, pero eventualmente necesitaras también completar las cosas. En la vista Views/Todo/Index.cshtml, una casilla de verificación es, mostrada para cada tarea:\n\n\nPresionando la casilla de verificación no hace nada aun. Al igual que en el capítulo anterior, agregaras este comportamiento usando formularios y acciones. En este caso necesitaras un pequeño código en Javascript.\nAgregar elementos al formulario de la vista\nPrimero, actualiza la vista y encierra cada casilla de verificación con un elemento . Después, agregar un elemento oculto que contenga el ID de la tarea:\nViews/Todo/Index.cshtml\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nCuando el bucle foreach se ejecuta en la vista e imprime una fila para cada tarea pendiente, existirá una copia de este formulario en cada fila. La entrada oculta que contiene el ID de la tarea a realizar permite que el código de su controlador indique qué casilla se marcó. (Sin él, podría indicar que se marcó alguna casilla, pero no cuál.)\nSi ejecutas la aplicación ahora mismo, las casillas de verificación aun no hacen nada, porque no hay un botón para submit para decir al navegador para crear una solicitud POST con los datos del formulario. Puedes agregar un botón de submit bajo cada casilla de verificación pero esto seria una mala experiencia de usuario. Idealmente dando clic en una casilla de verificación debería envía el formulario. Puedes lograrlo agregando algo de código de JavaScript.\nAgregar código Javascript\nBusca el archivo site.js en el directorio wwwroot/js y agrega este código: \nwwwroot/js/site.js\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\n    // Wire up all of the checkboxes to run markCompleted()\n    $('.done-checkbox').on('click', function(e) {\n        markCompleted(e.target);\n    });\n});\n\nfunction markCompleted(checkbox) {\n    checkbox.disabled = true;\n\n    var row = checkbox.closest('tr');\n    $(row).addClass('done');\n\n    var form = checkbox.closest('form');\n    form.submit();\n}\n\nEste código primero usa jQuery (a una librería de apoyo en JavaScript) para adjuntar algo de código al evento click de todos las casillas de verificación sobre la página con la clase CSS done-checkbox. Cuando una casilla de verificación es presionada, la función markCompleted() es ejecutada.\nLa función markCompleted() hace algunas cosas:\n\nAgrega el atributo disabled a las casillas de verificación así estas no pueden ser selecionadas otra vez\nAgrega la clase CSS done a la fila padre que contiene la casilla de verificación, la cual cambia la forma que la final luce basada en las reglas CSS en el archivo style.css\nEnviar el formulario\n\nEsto toma responsabilidad del la vista y el código del lado del cliente. Ahora es tiempo de agregar una nueva acción\nAgregar una acción al controlador\nComo haz probablemente adivinado, necesitas agregar una acción llamada MarkDone en el controlador TodoController:\n[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\npublic async Task MarkDone(Guid id)\n{\n    if (id == Guid.Empty)\n    {\n        return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n    }\n\n    var successful = await _todoItemService.MarkDoneAsync(id);\n    if (!successful)\n    {\n        return BadRequest(\"Could not mark item as done.\");\n    }\n\n    return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n}\n\nVayamos a través de cada línea de este método de acción. Primero, el método acepta un parámetro Guid llamadoid en la firma del método. A diferencia de la acción AddItem, que utiliza un modelo y un modelo de enlace / validación, el parámetro id es muy simple. Si los datos de la solicitud entrante incluyen un campo llamado id, ASP.NET Core intentará analizarlo como una guía. Esto funciona porque el elemento oculto que agregó al formulario de casilla de verificación se llama id.\nComo no está utilizando el enlace de modelo, no hay un ModelState para verificar la validez. En su lugar, puede verificar el valor GUID directamente para asegurarse de que sea válido. Si, por algún motivo, el parámetro id en la solicitud faltaba o no podía analizarse como guid, id tendrá un valor de Guid.Empty. Si ese es el caso, la acción le dice al navegador que redirija a /Todo/Index y actualice la página.\nA continuación, el controlador debe llamar a la capa de servicio para actualizar la base de datos. Esto será manejado por un nuevo método llamado MarkDoneAsync en la interfaz ITodoItemService, que devolverá verdadero o falso dependiendo de si la actualización tuvo éxito:\nvar successful = await _todoItemService.MarkDoneAsync(id);\nif (!successful)\n{\n    return BadRequest(\"Could not mark item as done.\");\n}\n\nFinalmente, si todo se ve bien, el navegador se redirige a la acción /Todo/Index y la página se actualiza.\nCon la vista y el controlador actualizados, todo lo que queda es agregar el método de servicio faltante.\nAgregar un método de servicio\nPrimero, agregar MarkDoneAsync a la definición de la interface:\nServices/ITodoItemService.cs\nTask MarkDoneAsync(Guid id);\n\nDespués, agrega la implementación concreta al servicio TodoItemService: \nServices/TodoItemService.cs\npublic async Task MarkDoneAsync(Guid id)\n{\n    var item = await _context.Items\n        .Where(x => x.Id == id)\n        .SingleOrDefaultAsync();\n\n    if (item == null) return false;\n\n    item.IsDone = true;\n\n    var saveResult = await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n    return saveResult == 1; // One entity should have been updated\n}\n\nEste método usa Entity Framework Core y Where() para encontrar una tarea por ID en la base de datos. El método SingleOrDefaultAsync() regresara una tarea o null si esta no es encontrada.\nUna vez que estas seguro que el item no es nulo, es una simple cuestión de configurar la propiedad IsDone:\nitem.IsDone = true;\n\nCambiando la propiedad solo afecta a la copia local de la tarea hasta que el método SaveChangesAsync() es llamada para guardar el cambio en la base de datos. SaveChangesAsync() regresa un numero que indica cuántas entidades fueron actualizas durante la operación de guardar. En este caso, sera o 1 (la tarea fue actualizada) o (algo malo sucedió).\nProbando\nEjecuta la aplicación y checa algunas tareas de la lista. Refrescar la página y ellas desaparecerán completamente, porque el filtro Where() aplicado en el método GetIncompleteItemsAsync().\nAhora mismo, la aplicación contiene una sola, lista de tareas compartida. Seria mucho más util si mantuviera registros de una lista de tareas individual para cada usuario. En el siguiente capítulo, agregarás inicio de sesión y características de seguridad al proyecto.\n"},"chapters/security-and-identity/":{"url":"chapters/security-and-identity/","title":"Seguridad e Identidad","keywords":"","body":"Seguridad e identidad\nLa seguridad es una de las principales preocupaciones de cualquier aplicación web moderna o API. Es importante mantener seguros los datos de sus usuarios o usuarios y fuera del alcance de los atacantes. Este es un tema muy amplio, que involucra cosas como:\n\nDesinfección de entrada de datos para evitar ataques de inyección de SQL.\nPrevención de ataques de falsificación de petición en sitios cruzados(CSRF) en formularios\nUtilizando HTTPS (cifrado de conexión) para que los datos no puedan ser interceptados mientras viaja a través de Internet\nProporcionar a los usuarios una forma segura de iniciar sesión con una contraseña u otras credenciales\nDiseño de restablecimiento de contraseñas, recuperación de cuentas y flujos de autenticación multifactor\n\nASP.NET Core puede ayudar a que todo esto sea más fácil de implementar. Los dos primeros (protección contra inyección de SQL y ataques de falsificación de petición en sitios cruzados) ya están incorporados, y puede agregar algunas líneas de código para habilitar el soporte de HTTPS. Este capítulo se centrará principalmente en los aspectos de identidad** de seguridad: manejo de cuentas de usuario, autenticación (inicio de sesión) de sus usuarios de forma segura y toma de decisiones de autorización una vez que se autentiquen.\n\nLa autenticación y la autorización son ideas distintas que a menudo se confunden. La autenticación se ocupa de si un usuario está conectado, mientras que la autorización se ocupa de lo que está autorizado a hacer después de que inicie sesión. Se puede pensar en la autenticación como una pregunta: \"¿Sé quién? este usuario es? \" Mientras que la autorización pregunta: \"¿Tiene este usuario permiso para hacer X?\"\n\nLa plantilla de autenticación individual de MVC + que usó para organizar el proyecto incluye varias clases creadas sobre ASP.NET Core Identity, un sistema de autenticación e identidad que forma parte de ASP.NET Core. Fuera de la caja, esto agrega la capacidad de iniciar sesión con un correo electrónico y una contraseña.\n¿Qué es ASP.NET Core Identity?\nASP.NET Core Identity es el sistema de identidad que se incluye con ASP.NET Core. Como todo lo demás en el ecosistema de ASP.NET Core, es un conjunto de paquetes de NuGet que se pueden instalar en cualquier proyecto (y ya están incluidos si usa la plantilla predeterminada).\nASP.NET Core Identity se encarga de almacenar las cuentas de usuario, el hash y el almacenamiento de las contraseñas y la administración de roles para los usuarios. Es compatible con el inicio de sesión de correo electrónico / contraseña, autenticación multifactorial, inicio de sesión social con proveedores como Google y Facebook, así como la conexión a otros servicios mediante protocolos como OAuth 2.0 y OpenID Connect.\nLas vistas de registro e inicio de sesión que se suministran con la plantilla de MVC + autenticación individual ya aprovechan la identidad central de ASP.NET, ¡y ya funcionan! Intenta registrarte para obtener una cuenta e iniciar sesión.\n"},"chapters/security-and-identity/require-authentication.html":{"url":"chapters/security-and-identity/require-authentication.html","title":"Requerir autenticación","keywords":"","body":"Requerir autenticación\nA menudo, deseará que el usuario inicie sesión antes de poder acceder a ciertas partes de su aplicación. Por ejemplo, tiene sentido mostrar la página de inicio a todos (ya sea que haya iniciado sesión o no), pero solo mostrar su lista de tareas después de haber iniciado sesión.\nPuede usar el atributo [Authorize] en ASP.NET Core para requerir que un usuario que haya iniciado sesión para una acción particular, o un controlador completo. Para requerir autenticación para todas las acciones del TodoController, agregue el atributo encima de la primera línea del controlador:\nControllers/TodoController.cs\n[Authorize]\npublic class TodoController : Controller\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\nAgregue esta declaración using en la parte superior del archivo:\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;\n\nIntenta ejecutar la aplicación y acceder a /todo sin iniciar sesión.

Ahora que el atributo [Authorize] asegura que debe iniciar sesión para ver la vista de tareas, puede filtrar la consulta de la base de datos según quién haya iniciado sesión.\nPrimero, inyecte un UserManager en el TodoController:\nControllers/TodoController.cs\n[Authorize]\npublic class TodoController : Controller\n{\n    private readonly ITodoItemService _todoItemService;\n    private readonly UserManager _userManager;\n\n    public TodoController(ITodoItemService todoItemService,\n        UserManager userManager)\n    {\n        _todoItemService = todoItemService;\n        _userManager = userManager;\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nDeberá agregar una nueva declaración using en la parte superior:\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;\n\nLa clase UserManager es parte de ASP.NET Core Identity. Puedes usarlo para obtener al usuario actual en la acción Index:\npublic async Task Index()\n{\n    var currentUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\n    if (currentUser == null) return Challenge();\n\n    var items = await _todoItemService\n        .GetIncompleteItemsAsync(currentUser);\n\n    var model = new TodoViewModel()\n    {\n        Items = items\n    };\n\n    return View(model);\n}\n\nEl nuevo código en la parte superior del método de acción utiliza el UserManager para buscar al usuario actual en la propiedadUsuario disponible en la acción:\nvar currentUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\n\nSi hay un usuario que ha iniciado sesión, la propiedad User contiene un objeto ligero con algo (pero no toda) la información del usuario. El UserManager usa esto para buscar los detalles completos del usuario en la base de datos a través del método GetUserAsync().\nEl valor de currentUser nunca debe ser nulo, porque el atributo [Authorize] está presente en el controlador. Sin embargo, es una buena idea hacer un control de cordura, por si acaso. Puede usar el método Challenge() para forzar al usuario a iniciar sesión nuevamente si falta su información:\nif (currentUser == null) return Challenge();\n\nComo ahora estás pasando un parámetro ApplicationUser a GetIncompleteItemsAsync(), deberás actualizar la interfaz ITodoItemService:\nServices/ITodoItemService.cs\npublic interface ITodoItemService\n{\n    Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync(\n        ApplicationUser user);\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nYa que cambió la interfaz ITodoItemService, también necesita actualizar la firma del método GetIncompleteItemsAsync() en el TodoItemService:\nServices/TodoItemService\npublic async Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync(\n    ApplicationUser user)\n\nEl siguiente paso es actualizar la consulta de la base de datos y agregar un filtro para mostrar solo los elementos creados por el usuario actual. Antes de que pueda hacer eso, debe agregar una nueva propiedad a la base de datos.\nActualizar la base de datos\nDeberá agregar una nueva propiedad al modelo de entidad TodoItem para que cada elemento pueda \"recordar\" al usuario que lo posee:\nModels/TodoItem.cs\npublic string UserId { get; set; }\n\nDado que ha actualizado el modelo de entidad utilizado por el contexto de la base de datos, también debe migrar la base de datos. Crea una nueva migración usando dotnet ef en el terminal:\ndotnet ef migrations add AddItemUserId\nEsto crea una nueva migración llamada AddItemUserId que agregará una nueva columna a la tabla Items, reflejando el cambio realizado en el modelo TodoItem.\nUtilice dotnet ef de nuevo para aplicarlo a la base de datos:\ndotnet ef database update\nActualizar la clase de servicio\nCon la base de datos y el contexto de la base de datos actualizados, ahora puede actualizar el método GetIncompleteItemsAsync() en el TodoItemService y agregar otra cláusula a la declaración Where:\nServices/TodoItemService.cs\npublic async Task GetIncompleteItemsAsync(\n    ApplicationUser user)\n{\n    return await _context.Items\n        .Where(x => x.IsDone == false && x.UserId == user.Id)\n        .ToArrayAsync();\n}\n\nSi ejecuta la aplicación y se registra o inicia sesión, verá una lista de tareas vacía una vez más. Desafortunadamente, cualquier tarea que intentes agregar desaparece en el éter, porque aún no has actualizado la acción AddItem para que el usuario la tenga en cuenta.\nActualizar las acciones AddItem y MarkDone\nDeberá usar el UserManager para obtener el usuario actual en los métodos de acción AddItem y MarkDone, tal como lo hizo en Index.\nAquí están los dos métodos actualizados:\nControllers/TodoController.cs\n[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\npublic async Task AddItem(TodoItem newItem)\n{\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\n    {\n        return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n    }\n\n    var currentUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\n    if (currentUser == null) return Challenge();\n\n    var successful = await _todoItemService\n        .AddItemAsync(newItem, currentUser);\n\n    if (!successful)\n    {\n        return BadRequest(\"Could not add item.\");\n    }\n\n    return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n}\n\n[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]\npublic async Task MarkDone(Guid id)\n{\n    if (id == Guid.Empty)\n    {\n        return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n    }\n\n    var currentUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\n    if (currentUser == null) return Challenge();\n\n    var successful = await _todoItemService\n        .MarkDoneAsync(id, currentUser);\n\n    if (!successful)\n    {\n        return BadRequest(\"Could not mark item as done.\");\n    }\n\n    return RedirectToAction(\"Index\");\n}\n\nAmbos métodos de servicio ahora deben aceptar un parámetro ApplicationUser. Actualice la definición de la interfaz en ITodoItemService:\nTask AddItemAsync(TodoItem newItem, ApplicationUser user);\n\nTask MarkDoneAsync(Guid id, ApplicationUser user);\n\nY por último, actualice la implementación del método del servicio en TodoItemService. En el método AddItemAsync, establece la propiedad UserId cuando construyas un nuevo TodoItem:\npublic async Task AddItemAsync(\n    TodoItem newItem, ApplicationUser user)\n{\n    newItem.Id = Guid.NewGuid();\n    newItem.IsDone = false;\n    newItem.DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(3);\n    newItem.UserId = user.Id;\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nLa cláusula Where en el método MarkDoneAsync también debe verificar la ID del usuario, por lo que un usuario deshonesto no puede completar las tareas de otra persona adivinando sus ID:\npublic async Task MarkDoneAsync(\n    Guid id, ApplicationUser user)\n{\n    var item = await _context.Items\n        .Where(x => x.Id == id && x.UserId == user.Id)\n        .SingleOrDefaultAsync();\n\n    // ...\n}\n\n¡Todo listo!

Si los usuarios normales intentan acceder a él, verán un error.\nAgregar una página Administrar usuarios\nPrimero, crea un nuevo controlador:\nControllers/ManageUsersController.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Models;\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Controllers\n{\n    [Authorize(Roles = \"Administrator\")]\n    public class ManageUsersController : Controller\n    {\n        private readonly UserManager\n            _userManager;\n\n        public ManageUsersController(\n            UserManager userManager)\n        {\n            _userManager = userManager;\n        }\n\n        public async Task Index()\n        {\n            var admins = (await _userManager\n                .GetUsersInRoleAsync(\"Administrator\"))\n                .ToArray();\n\n            var everyone = await _userManager.Users\n                .ToArrayAsync();\n\n            var model = new ManageUsersViewModel\n            {\n                Administrators = admins,\n                Everyone = everyone\n            };\n\n            return View(model);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nLa configuración de la propiedad Roles en el atributo [Authorize]garantizará que el usuario tenga que iniciar sesión y se le asigne el rol de Administrador para poder ver la página.\nA continuación, crea un modelo para la vista:\nModels/ManageUsersViewModel.cs\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.Models\n{\n    public class ManageUsersViewModel\n    {\n        public ApplicationUser[] Administrators { get; set; }\n\n        public ApplicationUser[] Everyone { get; set;}\n    }\n}\n\nFinalmente, cree una carpeta Views/ManageUsers y una vista para la acción Index:\nViews/ManageUsers/Index.cshtml\n@model ManageUsersViewModel\n\n@{\n    ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Manage users\";\n}\n\n@ViewData[\"Title\"]\n\nAdministrators\n\n\n    \n        \n            Id\n            Email\n        \n    \n\n    @foreach (var user in Model.Administrators)\n    {\n        \n            @user.Id\n            @user.Email\n        \n    }\n\n\nEveryone\n\n\n    \n        \n            Id\n            Email\n        \n    \n\n    @foreach (var user in Model.Everyone)\n    {\n        \n            @user.Id\n            @user.Email\n        \n    }\n\n\nInicie la aplicación e intente acceder a la ruta /ManageUsers mientras esté conectado como un usuario normal.

Si no, crea uno. En lugar de escribir repetidamente la cadena \"Administrador\", cree una pequeña clase llamada Constants para mantener el valor:\nConstants.cs\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo\n{\n    public static class Constants\n    {\n        public const string AdministratorRole = \"Administrator\";\n    }\n}\n\n\nSi lo desea, puede actualizar el ManageUsersController para usar este valor constante también.\n\nA continuación, escriba el método EnsureTestAdminAsync():\nSeedData.cs\nprivate static async Task EnsureTestAdminAsync(\n    UserManager userManager)\n{\n    var testAdmin = await userManager.Users\n        .Where(x => x.UserName == \"admin@todo.local\")\n        .SingleOrDefaultAsync();\n\n    if (testAdmin != null) return;\n\n    testAdmin = new ApplicationUser\n    {\n        UserName = \"admin@todo.local\",\n        Email = \"admin@todo.local\"\n    };\n    await userManager.CreateAsync(\n        testAdmin, \"NotSecure123!!\");\n    await userManager.AddToRoleAsync(\n        testAdmin, Constants.AdministratorRole);\n}\n\nSi no hay un usuario con el nombre de usuario admin@todo.local en la base de datos, este método creará uno y le asignará una contraseña temporal. Después de iniciar sesión por primera vez, ¡debe cambiar la contraseña de la cuenta a algo seguro!\nA continuación, debe indicar a su aplicación que ejecute esta lógica cuando se inicie. Modifique Program.cs y actualice Main()para llamar a un nuevo método, InitializeDatabase():\nProgram.cs\npublic static void Main(string[] args)\n{\n    var host = BuildWebHost(args);\n    InitializeDatabase(host);\n    host.Run();\n}\n\nLuego, agregue el nuevo método a la clase debajo de Main():\nprivate static void InitializeDatabase(IWebHost host)\n{\n    using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope())\n    {\n        var services = scope.ServiceProvider;\n\n        try\n        {\n            SeedData.InitializeAsync(services).Wait();\n        }\n        catch (Exception ex)\n        {\n            var logger = services\n                .GetRequiredService>();\n            logger.LogError(ex, \"Error occurred seeding the DB.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAgregue esta declaración using al principio del archivo:\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\n\nEste método obtiene la colección de servicios que necesita SeedData.InitializeAsync() y luego ejecuta el método para inicializar la base de datos. Si algo sale mal, se registra un error.\n\nComo InitializeAsync() devuelve un Task, el método Wait()debe usarse para asegurarse de que finaliza antes de que la aplicación se inicie. Normalmente utilizarías \"esperar\" para esto, pero por razones técnicas no puedes usar \"esperar\" en la clase \"Programa\". Esta es una rara excepción. ¡Debes usar await en cualquier otro lugar!\n\nCuando inicie la aplicación a continuación, la cuenta admin@todo.local se creará y se le asignará el rol de Administrador. Intente iniciar sesión con esta cuenta y navegue a http://localhost:5000/ManageUsers. Verás una lista de todos los usuarios registrados para la aplicación.\n\nComo desafío adicional, intente agregar más funciones de administración a esta página. Por ejemplo, podría agregar un botón que le dé a un administrador la posibilidad de eliminar una cuenta de usuario.\n\nVerificar la autorización en una vista\nEl atributo [Authorize] facilita la verificación de autorización en un controlador o método de acción, pero ¿qué sucede si necesita verificar la autorización en una vista? Por ejemplo, sería bueno mostrar un enlace \"Administrar usuarios\" en la barra de navegación si el usuario que ha iniciado sesión es un administrador.\nPuede inyectar el UserManager directamente en una vista para realizar estos tipos de comprobaciones de autorización. Para mantener sus vistas limpias y organizadas, cree una nueva vista parcial que agregará un elemento a la barra de navegación en el diseño:\nViews/Shared/_AdminActionsPartial.cshtml\n@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity\n@using AspNetCoreTodo.Models\n\n@inject SignInManager signInManager\n@inject UserManager userManager\n\n@if (signInManager.IsSignedIn(User))\n{\n    var currentUser = await userManager.GetUserAsync(User);\n\n    var isAdmin = currentUser != null\n        && await userManager.IsInRoleAsync(\n            currentUser,\n            Constants.AdministratorRole);\n\n    if (isAdmin)\n    {\n        \n            \n                \n                   Manage Users\n                \n            \n        \n    }\n}\n\n\nEs una convención nombrar vistas parciales compartidas que comienzan con un guión bajo _, pero no es obligatorio.\n\nEsta vista parcial primero utiliza el SignInManager para determinar rápidamente si el usuario está conectado. Si no lo está, el resto del código de vista se puede omitir. Si hay hay un usuario conectado, el UserManager se utiliza para buscar sus detalles y realizar una verificación de autorización con IsInRoleAsync(). Si todas las comprobaciones son correctas y el usuario es un administrador, se agrega un enlace Administrar usuarios a la barra de navegación.\nPara incluir este parcial en el diseño principal, edite _Layout.cshtml y agréguelo a la sección de la barra de navegación:\nViews/Shared/_Layout.cshtml\n\n    \n        \n    \n    @await Html.PartialAsync(\"_LoginPartial\")\n    @await Html.PartialAsync(\"_AdminActionsPartial\")\n\n\nCuando inicie sesión con una cuenta de administrador, ahora verá un nuevo elemento en la parte superior derecha:\n\n"},"chapters/security-and-identity/more-resources.html":{"url":"chapters/security-and-identity/more-resources.html","title":"Más recursos","keywords":"","body":"Más recursos\nASP.NET Core Identity le ayuda a agregar las características de seguridad e identidad como inicio de sesión y registro a su aplicación. Las plantillas dotnet new le brindan vistas y controladores predefinidos que manejan estos escenarios comunes para que pueda comenzar a trabajar rápidamente.\nHay mucho más que puede hacer ASP.NET Core Identity, como restablecer la contraseña y el inicio de sesión social. La documentación disponible en http://docs.asp.net es un recurso fantástico para aprender a agregar estas funciones.\nAlternativas a la identidad central de ASP.NET\nASP.NET Core Identity no es la única forma de agregar funcionalidad de identidad. Otro enfoque es utilizar un servicio de identidad alojado en la nube como Azure Active Directory B2C u Okta para manejar la identidad de su aplicación. Puedes pensar en estas opciones como parte de una progresión:\n\nSeguridad haz la tu mismo: no se recomienda, a menos que sea un experto en seguridad.\nASP.NET Core Identity: Con las plantillas se obtiene una gran cantidad de código de forma inmediata, lo que hace que sea bastante fácil comenzar. Aún así deberá escribir algo de código para escenarios más avanzados y mantener una base de datos para almacenar información del usuario.\nServicios de identidad alojados en la nube. El servicio maneja escenarios simples y avanzados (autenticación multifactor, recuperación de cuenta, federación) y reduce significativamente la cantidad de código que necesita escribir y mantener en su aplicación. Además, los datos confidenciales del usuario no se almacenan en su propia base de datos.\n\nPara este proyecto, ASP.NET Core Identity es una excelente opción. Para proyectos más complejos, recomiendo investigar un poco y experimentar con ambas opciones para comprender cuál es la mejor para su caso de uso.\n"},"chapters/automated-testing/":{"url":"chapters/automated-testing/","title":"Pruebas automáticas","keywords":"","body":"Pruebas automatizadas\nEscribir pruebas es una parte importante del desarrollo de cualquier aplicación. Probar su código lo ayuda a encontrar y evitar errores, y posteriormente facilita la refactorización de su código sin descomponer la funcionalidad o introducir nuevos problemas.\nEn este capítulo, aprenderá cómo escribir dos tipos de pruebas: pruebas de unitarias y pruebas de integración que utilizan su aplicación de ASP.NET Core. Las pruebas unitarias son pruebas pequeñas que prueban que un solo método o parte de la lógica funcione correctamente. Las pruebas de integración (a veces llamadas pruebas funcionales) son pruebas más grandes que simulan escenarios reales y prueban múltiples capas o partes de su aplicación.\n"},"chapters/automated-testing/unit-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/automated-testing/unit-testing.html","title":"Pruebas unitarias","keywords":"","body":"Pruebas unitarias\nLas pruebas unitarias son pruebas pequeñas y cortas que verifican el comportamiento de un solo método o clase. Cuando el código que está probando se basa en otros métodos o clases, las pruebas unitarias se basan en simulardores de esas otras clases para que la prueba solo se enfoque en una cosa a la vez.\nPor ejemplo, la clase TodoController tiene dos dependencias: un ITodoItemService y el UserManager. El TodoItemService, a su vez, depende del ApplicationDbContext. (La idea de que puede dibujar una línea desde TodoController>TodoItemService>ApplicationDbContext se llama gráfico de dependencia).\nCuando la aplicación se ejecuta normalmente, el sistema de inyección de dependencias y el contenedor de servicios de ASP.NET Core inyecta cada uno de esos objetos en el gráfico de dependencia cuando se crea el TodoController o el TodoItemService.\nCuando escribe una prueba de unitaria, por otro lado, tiene que manejar usted mismo el gráfico de dependencia. Es típico proporcionar versiones solo de prueba o \"simuladas\" de esas dependencias. Esto significa que puede aislar solo la lógica en la clase o el método que está probando. (¡Esto es importante! Si está probando un servicio, no quiere también estar escribiendo accidentalmente en su base de datos).\nCrear un proyecto de prueba\nEs una buena práctica crear un proyecto separado para sus pruebas, para que se mantengan separados del código de su aplicación. El nuevo proyecto de prueba debe vivir en un directorio que esté al lado (no dentro) del directorio de su proyecto principal.\nSi actualmente se encuentra en el directorio de su proyecto, cd sube un nivel. (Este directorio raíz también se llamará AspNetCoreTodo). Luego use este comando para crear un nuevo proyecto de prueba:\ndotnet new xunit -o AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\nxUnit.NET es un marco de prueba popular para el código .NET que se puede usar para escribir pruebas de unitarias y de integración. Como todo lo demás, es un conjunto de paquetes NuGet que se pueden instalar en cualquier proyecto. La plantilla dotnet new xunit ya incluye todo lo que necesitas.\nSu estructura de directorio ahora debería verse así:\nAspNetCoreTodo/\n    AspNetCoreTodo/\n        AspNetCoreTodo.csproj\n        Controllers/\n        (etc...)\n\n    AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests/\n        AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests.csproj\nComo el proyecto de prueba utilizará las clases definidas en su proyecto principal, deberá agregar una referencia al proyecto AspNetCoreTodo:\ndotnet agregar referencia ../AspNetCoreTodo/AspNetCoreTodo.csproj\nElimine el archivo UnitTest1.cs que se crea automáticamente. Estás listo para escribir tu primera prueba.\n\nSi está utilizando Visual Studio Code, es posible que deba cerrar y volver a abrir la ventana de Visual Studio Code para la compleción del código funcione en el nuevo proyecto.\n\nEscribe una prueba de servicio\nEche un vistazo a la lógica en el método AddItemAsync() del TodoItemService:\npublic async Task AddItemAsync(\n    TodoItem newItem, ApplicationUser user)\n{\n    newItem.Id = Guid.NewGuid();\n    newItem.IsDone = false;\n    newItem.DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(3);\n    newItem.UserId = user.Id;\n\n    _context.Items.Add(newItem);\n\n    var saveResult = await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\n    return saveResult == 1;\n}\n\nEste método toma una serie de decisiones o suposiciones sobre el nuevo elemento (en otras palabras, realiza la lógica de negocios en el nuevo elemento) antes de que realmente lo guarde en la base de datos:\n\nLa propiedad UserId debe establecerse a la ID del usuario\nLos nuevos elementos siempre deben estar incompletos (IsDone = false)\nEl título del nuevo elemento debe copiarse de newItem.Title\nLas nuevos tareas siempre deben vencer dentro de 3 días\n\nImagínese si usted o alguien más reformuló el método AddItemAsync() y se olvidó de parte de esta lógica de negocios. ¡El comportamiento de su aplicación podría cambiar sin que usted se dé cuenta! Puede evitar esto escribiendo una prueba que verifique que esta lógica de negocios no haya cambiado (incluso si la implementación interna del método cambia).\n\nPuede parecer poco probable ahora que pueda introducir un cambio en la lógica empresarial sin darse cuenta, pero es mucho más difícil hacer un seguimiento de las decisiones y suposiciones en un proyecto grande y complejo. Cuanto más grande sea su proyecto, más importante es tener controles automáticos que aseguren que nada haya cambiado.\n\nPara escribir una prueba unitaria que verifique la lógica en TodoItemService, cree una nueva clase en su proyecto de prueba:\nAspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests/TodoItemServiceShould.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Data;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Models;\nusing AspNetCoreTodo.Services;\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\nusing Xunit;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\n{\n    public class TodoItemServiceShould\n    {\n        [Fact]\n        public async Task AddNewItemAsIncompleteWithDueDate()\n        {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nHay muchas maneras diferentes de nombrar y organizar pruebas, todas con diferentes pros y contras. Me gusta después de fijar mis clases de prueba con Debería para crear una oración legible con el nombre del método de prueba, ¡pero puede usar su propio estilo!\n\nEl atributo [Fact] proviene del paquete xUnit.NET, y marca este método como un método de prueba.\nEl TodoItemService requiere un ApplicationDbContext, que normalmente está conectado a su base de datos. No querrás usar eso para las pruebas. En su lugar, puede usar el proveedor de base de datos en memoria de Entity Framework Core en su código de prueba. Como toda la base de datos existe en la memoria, se borra cada vez que se reinicia la prueba. Y, dado que es un proveedor adecuado de Entity Framework Core, ¡TodoItemService no notará la diferencia!\nUse un DbContextOptionsBuilder para configurar el proveedor de la base de datos en memoria, y luego haga una llamada a AddItemAsync ():\nvar options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder()\n    .UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: \"Test_AddNewItem\").Options;\n\n// Set up a context (connection to the \"DB\") for writing\nusing (var context = new ApplicationDbContext(options))\n{\n    var service = new TodoItemService(context);\n\n    var fakeUser = new ApplicationUser\n    {\n        Id = \"fake-000\",\n        UserName = \"fake@example.com\"\n    };\n\n    await service.AddItemAsync(new TodoItem\n    {\n        Title = \"Testing?\"\n    }, fakeUser);\n}\n\nLa última línea crea un tarea llamado \"¿Pruebas?\", Y le dice al servicio que lo guarde en la base de datos (en memoria).\nPara verificar que la lógica de negocio funcionó correctamente, escriba un código más debajo del bloque using existente:\n// Use a separate context to read data back from the \"DB\"\nusing (var context = new ApplicationDbContext(options))\n{\n    var itemsInDatabase = await context\n        .Items.CountAsync();\n    Assert.Equal(1, itemsInDatabase);\n\n    var item = await context.Items.FirstAsync();\n    Assert.Equal(\"Testing?\", item.Title);\n    Assert.Equal(false, item.IsDone);\n\n    // Item should be due 3 days from now (give or take a second)\n    var difference = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(3) - item.DueAt;\n    Assert.True(difference \nLa primera afirmación es una comprobación de validez: nunca debe haber más de un elemento guardado en la base de datos en memoria. Suponiendo que eso sea cierto, la prueba recupera el elemento guardado con FirstAsync y luego afirma que las propiedades están establecidas en los valores esperados.\n\nTanto las pruebas de unitarias como las de integración generalmente siguen el patrón AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert): los objetos y los datos se configuran primero, luego se realiza alguna acción y, finalmente, la prueba verifica (Assert) que ocurrió el comportamiento esperado.\n\nConfirmar un valor de fecha y hora es un poco complicado, ya que la comparación de dos fechas para la igualdad fallará incluso si los componentes de milisegundos son diferentes. En su lugar, la prueba verifica que el valor DueAt esté a menos de un segundo del valor esperado.\nEjecutar la prueba\nEn la terminal, ejecute este comando (asegúrese de que todavía esté en el directorio AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests):\ndotnet test\nEl comando test escanea el proyecto actual en busca de pruebas (en este caso marcadas con los atributos [Fact]), y ejecuta todas las pruebas que encuentra. Verás una salida similar a:\nStarting test execution, please wait...\n Discovering: AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\n Discovered:  AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\n Starting:    AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\n Finished:    AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\n\nTotal tests: 1. Passed: 1. Failed: 0. Skipped: 0.\nTest Run Successful.\nTest execution time: 1.9074 Seconds\nAhora tiene una prueba que proporciona cobertura de prueba del TodoItemService. Como desafío adicional, intente escribir pruebas unitarias que aseguren:\n\nEl método MarkDoneAsync() devuelve falso si se pasa un ID que no existe\nEl método MarkDoneAsync() devuelve true cuando se marca una tarea como completa.\nEl método GetIncompleteItemsAsync() devuelve solo las tareas que pertenecen a un usuario en particular\n\n"},"chapters/automated-testing/integration-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/automated-testing/integration-testing.html","title":"Pruebas de integración","keywords":"","body":"Pruebas de integración\nEn comparación con las pruebas unitarias, las pruebas de integración tienen un alcance mucho mayor. Prueba toda la pila de aplicaciones. En lugar de aislar una clase o método, las pruebas de integración aseguran que todos los componentes de su aplicación estén funcionando juntos correctamente: enrutamiento, controladores, servicios, código de base de datos, etc.\nLas pruebas de integración son más lentas y más complejas que las pruebas de unitarias, por lo que es común que un proyecto tenga muchas pruebas de unitarias pequeñas pero solo un puñado de pruebas de integración.\nPara probar toda la pila (incluido el enrutamiento del controlador), las pruebas de integración normalmente hacen llamadas HTTP a su aplicación como lo haría un navegador web.\nPara realizar una prueba de integración, puede iniciar su aplicación y realizar solicitudes manualmente a http://localhost:5000. Sin embargo, ASP.NET Core ofrece una mejor alternativa: la clase TestServer. Esta clase puede alojar su aplicación durante la duración de la prueba, y luego detenerla automáticamente cuando se completa la prueba.\nCrear un proyecto de prueba\nSi actualmente se encuentra en el directorio de su proyecto, cd sube un nivel al directorio raíz AspNetCoreTodo. Use este comando para crear un nuevo proyecto de prueba:\ndotnet new xunit -o AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\nSu estructura de directorio ahora debería verse así:\nAspNetCoreTodo/\n    AspNetCoreTodo/\n        AspNetCoreTodo.csproj\n        Controllers/\n        (etc...)\n\n    AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests/\n        AspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests.csproj\n\n    AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests/\n        AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests.csproj\n\nSi lo prefiere, puede mantener sus pruebas unitarias y pruebas de integración en el mismo proyecto. Para proyectos grandes, es común dividirlos para que sea fácil ejecutarlos por separado.\n\nDado que el proyecto de prueba utilizará las clases definidas en su proyecto principal, deberá agregar una referencia al proyecto principal:\ndotnet add reference ../AspNetCoreTodo/AspNetCoreTodo.csproj\nTambién deberá agregar el paquete NuGet Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost:\ndotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost\nElimine el archivo UnitTest1.cs creado por dotnet new. Estás listo para escribir una prueba de integración.\nEscribir una prueba de integración.\nHay algunas cosas que deben configurarse en el servidor de prueba antes de cada prueba. En lugar de abarrotar la prueba con este código de configuración, puede mantener esta configuración en una clase separada. Crea una nueva clase llamada TestFixture:\nAspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests/TestFixture.cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Net.Http;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\n\nnamespace AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\n{\n    public class TestFixture : IDisposable  \n    {\n        private readonly TestServer _server;\n\n        public HttpClient Client { get; }\n\n        public TestFixture()\n        {\n            var builder = new WebHostBuilder()\n                .UseStartup()\n                .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>\n                {\n                    config.SetBasePath(Path.Combine(\n                        Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(),\n                        \"..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\..\\\\AspNetCoreTodo\"));\n\n                    config.AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\");\n                });\n\n            _server = new TestServer(builder);\n\n            Client = _server.CreateClient();\n            Client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"http://localhost:8888\");\n        }\n\n        public void Dispose()\n        {\n            Client.Dispose();\n            _server.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nEsta clase se encarga de configurar un TestServer, y ayudará a mantener las pruebas limpias y ordenadas.\nAhora estás (realmente) listo para escribir una prueba de integración.

También es una buena prueba porque garantiza que nunca quitará accidentalmente el atributo [Authorize] y hará que la vista de tareas sea accesible para todos.\nEjecutar la prueba\nEjecute la prueba en el terminal con dotnet test. Si todo funciona bien, verás un mensaje de éxito:\nStarting test execution, please wait...\n Discovering: AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\n Discovered:  AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\n Starting:    AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\n Finished:    AspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\n\nTotal tests: 1.

Este capítulo no toca el código de prueba de interfaz de usuario (UI) ni el código de prueba (JavaScript), que probablemente merecen libros completos por su cuenta. Sin embargo, debe tener las habilidades y el conocimiento básico que necesita para aprender más sobre las pruebas y practicar la escritura de pruebas para sus propias aplicaciones.\nLa documentación de ASP.NET Core (https://docs.asp.net) y Stack Overflow son excelentes recursos para aprender más y encontrar respuestas cuando te quedas atascado.\n"},"chapters/deploy-the-application/":{"url":"chapters/deploy-the-application/","title":"Desplegando la aplicación","keywords":"","body":"Desplegar la aplicación\nHas recorrido un largo camino, pero aún no has terminado. Una vez que has creado una gran aplicación, ¡debes compartirla con el mundo!\nDebido a que las aplicaciones ASP.NET Core pueden ejecutarse en Windows, Mac o Linux, existen varias formas diferentes de implementar su aplicación. En este capítulo, te mostraré las formas más comunes (y más fáciles) de estar en línea.\nOpciones de implementación\nLas aplicaciones de ASP.NET Core se implementan normalmente en uno de estos entornos:\n\nUn host Docker. Cualquier máquina capaz de albergar contenedores Docker puede usarse para alojar una aplicación ASP.NET Core. Crear una imagen de Docker es una forma muy rápida de implementar su aplicación, especialmente si está familiarizado con Docker. (Si no lo eres, ¡no te preocupes! Cubriré los pasos más adelante).\n\nAzure. Microsoft Azure tiene soporte nativo para las aplicaciones de ASP.NET Core. Si tiene una suscripción a Azure, solo necesita crear una aplicación web y cargar los archivos de su proyecto. Cubriré cómo hacer esto con el CLI de Azure en la siguiente sección.\n\nLinux (con Nginx). Si no desea ir a la ruta Docker, aún puede alojar su aplicación en cualquier servidor Linux (esto incluye las máquinas virtuales Amazon EC2 y DigitalOcean). Es típico emparejar ASP.NET Core con el proxy inverso Nginx. (Más sobre Nginx a continuación.)\n\n\n\nWindows. Puede usar el servidor web IIS en Windows para alojar aplicaciones ASP.NET Core. Por lo general, es más fácil (y más barato) implementarlo en Azure, pero si prefiere administrar los servidores de Windows usted mismo, funcionará bien.\n\nKestrel y proxies inversos\n\nSi no le importan las agallas de hospedar aplicaciones ASP.NET Core y solo desea las instrucciones paso a paso, siéntase libre de saltar a una de las siguientes dos secciones.\n\nASP.NET Core incluye un servidor web rápido y ligero llamado Kestrel. Es el servidor que ha estado usando cada vez que ejecutó dotnet run y navegó a http://localhost:5000. Cuando implementas tu aplicación en un entorno de producción, aún utilizará Kestrel detrás de escena. Sin embargo, se recomienda que coloque un proxy inverso delante de Kestrel, porque Kestrel aún no tiene equilibrio de carga y otras características que tienen los servidores web más maduros.\nEn Linux (y en los contenedores Docker), puede usar Nginx o el servidor web Apache para recibir solicitudes entrantes de Internet y enrutarlas a su aplicación alojada con Kestrel. Si estás en Windows, IIS hace lo mismo.\nSi está utilizando Azure para alojar su aplicación, todo esto se hace automáticamente. Cubriré la configuración de Nginx como un proxy inverso en la sección de Docker.\n"},"chapters/deploy-the-application/deploy-to-azure.html":{"url":"chapters/deploy-the-application/deploy-to-azure.html","title":"Desplegando en Azure","keywords":"","body":"Desplegar en Azure\nLa implementación de la aplicación de ASP.NET Core en Azure solo lleva unos pocos pasos. Puede hacerlo a través del portal web de Azure o en la línea de comandos utilizando la CLI de Azure. Voy a cubrir este último.\nLo que necesitarás\n\nGit (usa git --version para asegurarte de que esté instalado)\nEl CLI de Azure (siga las instrucciones de instalación en https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli)\nUna suscripción de Azure (la suscripción gratuita está bien)\nUn archivo de configuración de implementación en la raíz de su proyecto.\n\nCrear un archivo de configuración de implementación\nComo hay múltiples proyectos en la estructura de su directorio (la aplicación web y dos proyectos de prueba), Azure no sabrá cuál publicar. Para solucionar este problema, cree un archivo llamado .deployment en la parte superior de la estructura de su directorio:\n.deployment\n[config]\nproject = AspNetCoreTodo/AspNetCoreTodo.csproj\n\nAsegúrese de guardar el archivo como .deployment sin otras partes en el nombre. (En Windows, puede que tenga que poner comillas alrededor del nombre del archivo, como \".deployment\", para evitar que se agregue una extensión .txt.)\nSi ejecuta el comando ls o dir en su directorio principal del proyecto, debería ver estos elementos:\n.deployment\nAspNetCoreTodo\nAspNetCoreTodo.IntegrationTests\nAspNetCoreTodo.UnitTests\nConfigurar los recursos de Azure\nSi acaba de instalar la CLI de Azure por primera vez, ejecute\naz login\ny siga las instrucciones para iniciar sesión en su máquina. Luego, crea un nuevo grupo de recursos para esta aplicación:\naz group create -l westus -n AspNetCoreTodoGroup\nEsto crea un grupo de recursos en la región oeste de los Estados Unidos. Si está ubicado lejos del oeste de los EE. UU., Use az account list-locations para obtener una lista de ubicaciones y encontrar una más cercana a usted.\nA continuación, cree un plan de Servicio de aplicaciones en el grupo que acaba de crear:\naz appservice plan create -g AspNetCoreTodoGroup -n AspNetCoreTodoPlan --sku F1\n\nF1 es el plan de aplicación gratuita. Si desea usar un nombre de dominio personalizado con su aplicación, use el plan D1 ($ 10 / mes) o superior.\n\nAhora cree una aplicación web en el plan del servicio de aplicaciones:\naz webapp create -g AspNetCoreTodoGroup -p AspNetCoreTodoPlan -n MyTodoApp\nEl nombre de la aplicación (MyTodoApp arriba) debe ser globalmente único en Azure. Una vez que se crea la aplicación, tendrá una URL predeterminada en el formato: http://mytodoapp.azurewebsites.net\nImplementa tus archivos de proyecto en Azure\nPuede usar Git para enviar sus archivos de aplicación a la aplicación web de Azure. Si su directorio local no ha sido rastreado como un repositorio de Git, ejecute estos comandos para configurarlo:\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"First commit!\"\nA continuación, cree un nombre de usuario y contraseña de Azure para la implementación:\naz webapp deployment user set --user-name nate\nSiga las instrucciones para crear una contraseña. Luego usa config-local-git para generar una URL de Git:\naz webapp deployment source config-local-git -g AspNetCoreTodoGroup -n MyTodoApp --out tsv\n\nhttps://nate@mytodoapp.scm.azurewebsites.net/MyTodoApp.git\nCopie la URL en el portapapeles y utilícela para agregar un control remoto Git a su repositorio local:\ngit remoto add azure \nSolo necesitas hacer estos pasos una vez. Ahora, cuando quiera enviar sus archivos de aplicaciones a Azure, verifíquelos con Git y ejecute\ngit push azure master\nVer una secuencia de mensajes de registro a medida que la aplicación se implementa en Azure.\nCuando esté completo, vaya a http://yourappname.azurewebsites.net para ver la aplicación.\n"},"chapters/deploy-the-application/deploy-with-docker.html":{"url":"chapters/deploy-the-application/deploy-with-docker.html","title":"Desplegando con Docker","keywords":"","body":"Desplegando con Docker\nSi no está utilizando una plataforma como Azure, las tecnologías de contenedorización como Docker pueden facilitar la implementación de aplicaciones web en sus propios servidores. En lugar de dedicar tiempo a configurar un servidor con las dependencias que necesita para ejecutar su aplicación, copiar archivos y reiniciar procesos, simplemente puede crear una imagen de Docker que describa todo lo que su aplicación necesita para ejecutar y girarla como un contenedor en cualquier Docker. anfitrión.\nDocker también puede hacer que escalar su aplicación en múltiples servidores sea más fácil. Una vez que tenga una imagen, usarla para crear 1 contenedor es el mismo proceso que crear 100 contenedores.\nAntes de comenzar, necesita tener instalada la CLI de Docker en su máquina de desarrollo. Busque \"get docker for (mac / windows / linux)\" y siga las instrucciones en el sitio web oficial de Docker. Puedes verificar que está instalado correctamente con\ndocker version\nAñadir un archivo docker\nLo primero que necesitará es un Dockerfile, que es como una receta que le dice a Docker lo que su aplicación necesita para construir y ejecutar.\nCree un archivo llamado Dockerfile (sin extensión) en la carpeta raíz, nivel superior AspNetCoreTodo. Ábrelo en tu editor favorito. Escribe la siguiente línea:\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-sdk AS build\n\nEsto le dice a Docker que use la imagen microsoft/dotnet:2.0-sdk como punto de partida. Esta imagen es publicada por Microsoft y contiene las herramientas y dependencias que necesita para ejecutar dotnet build y compilar su aplicación. Al utilizar esta imagen preconstruida como punto de partida, Docker puede optimizar la imagen producida para su aplicación y mantenerla pequeña.\nA continuación, agregue esta línea:\nCOPY AspNetCoreTodo/*.csproj ./app/AspNetCoreTodo/\n\nEl comando COPY copia el archivo de proyecto .csproj en la imagen en la ruta /app/AspNetCoreTodo/. Tenga en cuenta que todavía no se ha copiado en la imagen ninguno del código real (archivos .cs). Verás por qué en un minuto.\nWORKDIR /app/AspNetCoreTodo\nRUN dotnet restore\n\nWORKDIR es el equivalente de Docker decd. Esto significa que cualquier comando ejecutado a continuación se ejecutará desde el directorio / app / AspNetCoreTodo que el comandoCOPY creó en el último paso.\nEjecutar el comando dotnet restore restaura los paquetes NuGet que necesita la aplicación, definidos en el archivo .csproj. Al restaurar los paquetes dentro de la imagen antes agregando el resto del código, Docker puede almacenar en caché los paquetes restaurados. Luego, si realiza cambios de código (pero no cambia los paquetes definidos en el archivo de proyecto), la reconstrucción de la imagen de Docker será súper rápida.\nAhora es el momento de copiar el resto del código y compilar la aplicación:\nCOPY AspNetCoreTodo/. ./AspNetCoreTodo/\nRUN dotnet publish -o out /p:PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest=\"false\"\n\nEl comando dotnet publish compila el proyecto, y el indicador-o out coloca los archivos compilados en un directorio llamado out.\nEstos archivos compilados se utilizarán para ejecutar la aplicación con los últimos comandos:\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime AS runtime\nENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://+:80\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/AspNetCoreTodo/out ./\nENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"AspNetCoreTodo.dll\"]\n\nEl comando FROM se usa nuevamente para seleccionar una imagen más pequeña que solo tiene las dependencias necesarias para ejecutar la aplicación. El comando ENV se usa para establecer variables de entorno en el contenedor, y la variable de entornoASPNETCORE_URLS le dice a ASP.NET Core a qué interfaz de red y puerto debe enlazarse (en este caso, el puerto 80).\nEl comando ENTRYPOINT permite a Docker saber que el contenedor debe iniciarse como un ejecutable ejecutandodotnet AspNetCoreTodo.dll. Esto le dice a dotnet que inicie su aplicación desde el archivo compilado creado pordotnet publish anteriormente. (Cuando haces dotnet run durante el desarrollo, estás logrando lo mismo en un solo paso).\nEl Dockerfile completo se ve así:\nDockerfile\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-sdk AS build\nCOPY AspNetCoreTodo/*.csproj ./app/AspNetCoreTodo/\nWORKDIR /app/AspNetCoreTodo\nRUN dotnet restore\n\nCOPY AspNetCoreTodo/. ./\nRUN dotnet publish -o out /p:PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest=\"false\"\n\nFROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-runtime AS runtime\nENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://+:80\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/AspNetCoreTodo/out ./\nENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"AspNetCoreTodo.dll\"]\n\nCrear una imagen\nAsegúrese de que Dockerfile esté guardado y luego use docker build para crear una imagen:\ndocker build -t aspnetcoretodo .\n¡No te pierdas el período final! Eso le dice a Docker que busque un Dockerfile en el directorio actual.\nUna vez creada la imagen, puede ejecutar docker images para listar todas las imágenes disponibles en su máquina local. Para probarlo en un contenedor, ejecute\ndocker run --name aspnetcoretodo_sample --rm -it -p 8080:80 aspnetcoretodo\nEl indicador -it le dice a Docker que ejecute el contenedor en modo interactivo (dando salida al terminal, en lugar de ejecutarse en segundo plano). Cuando quieras detener el contenedor, presiona Control-C.\n¿Recuerda la variable ASPNETCORE_URLS que le dijo a ASP.NET Core que escuche en el puerto 80? La opción -p 8080: 80 le dice a Docker que asigne el puerto 8080 en su máquina al puerto del contenedor 80. Abra su navegador y navegue a http://localhost:8080 para ver la aplicación que se ejecuta en el contenedor !\nConfigurar Nginx\nAl principio de este capítulo, mencioné que debería usar un proxy inverso como Nginx para enviar las solicitudes a Kestrel. También puedes usar Docker para esto.\nLa arquitectura general constará de dos contenedores: un contenedor Nginx que escucha en el puerto 80 y reenvía las solicitudes al contenedor que acaba de construir y aloja su aplicación con Kestrel.\nEl contenedor Nginx necesita su propio archivo Docker. Para evitar que entre en conflicto con el Dockerfile que acaba de crear, cree un nuevo directorio en la raíz de la aplicación web:\nmkdir nginx\nCrea un nuevo Dockerfile y agrega estas líneas\nnginx/Dockerfile\nFROM nginx\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nNext, create an nginx.conf file:\nnginx/nginx.conf\nevents { worker_connections 1024; }\n\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        location / {\n          proxy_pass http://kestrel:80;\n          proxy_http_version 1.1;\n          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n          proxy_set_header Connection 'keep-alive';\n          proxy_set_header Host $host;\n          proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n        }\n    }\n}\nEste archivo de configuración le dice a Nginx que haga proxy de las solicitudes entrantes a http://kestrel:80. (Verás por qué kestrel funciona como nombre de host en un momento).\n\nCuando implementa su aplicación en un entorno de producción, debe agregar la directiva server_name y validar y restringir el encabezado del host a valores buenos conocidos. Para más información, ver:\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/295\n\nSet up Docker Compose\nAquí hay un archivo más para crear. Arriba en el directorio raíz, crea docker-compose.yml:\ndocker-compose.yml\nnginx:\n    build: ./nginx\n    links:\n        - kestrel:kestrel\n    ports:\n        - \"80:80\"\nkestrel:\n    build: .\n    ports:\n        - \"80\"\n\nDocker Compose es una herramienta que te ayuda a crear y ejecutar aplicaciones de múltiples contenedores. Este archivo de configuración define dos contenedores: nginx de la receta ./Nginx/Dockerfile, y kestrel de la receta ./Dockerfile. Los contenedores están explícitamente vinculados entre sí para que puedan comunicarse.\nPuede intentar girar toda la aplicación multi-contenedor ejecutando:\ndocker-compose up\nIntente abrir un navegador y navegue a http://localhost (puerto 80, no 8080). Nginx escucha en el puerto 80 (el puerto HTTP predeterminado) y envía solicitudes a su aplicación ASP.NET Core alojada por Kestrel.\nConfigurar un servidor Docker\nLas instrucciones de configuración específicas están fuera del alcance de este libro, pero se puede usar cualquier versión moderna de Linux (como Ubuntu) para configurar un host Docker. Por ejemplo, podría crear una máquina virtual con Amazon EC2 e instalar el servicio Docker. Puede buscar \"amazon ec2 setup up docker\" (por ejemplo) para obtener instrucciones.\nMe gusta usar DigitalOcean porque han hecho que sea muy fácil comenzar. DigitalOcean tiene una máquina virtual Docker pre-construida y tutoriales detallados para que Docker esté en funcionamiento (busque \"docker digitalocean\").\n"},"chapters/conclusion/":{"url":"chapters/conclusion/","title":"Conclusión","keywords":"","body":"Conclusión\nGracias por llegar hasta el final de El pequeño libro de ASP.NET Core!.
